# Agent Usage CLI

Monitor AI usage across Claude, ChatGPT, and GitHub Copilot from a single command.

## Quick Start

```bash
pnpm install  # Downloads Playwright Chromium (~300MB) automatically
pnpm run build

# Set up authentication (one-time setup per service)
node bin/agent-usage auth setup claude
node bin/agent-usage auth setup chatgpt
node bin/agent-usage auth setup github-copilot

# Check authentication status
node bin/agent-usage auth status

# Fetch usage
node bin/agent-usage
```

## Authentication

This tool uses browser-based authentication for persistent, long-lived sessions.

**Setup (one-time per service):**

```bash
# Set up authentication for each service
node bin/agent-usage auth setup claude
node bin/agent-usage auth setup chatgpt
node bin/agent-usage auth setup github-copilot

# Check authentication status
node bin/agent-usage auth status
```

When you run `auth setup`, a browser window will open. Simply log in to the service as you normally would. Your authentication will be saved and automatically used for future requests.

**Authenticated sessions are stored in:** `~/.agent-usage/browser-contexts/`

Security notes:

- Files in this directory contain sensitive session data. They are created with owner-only permissions (0600 for files, 0700 for the directory) where possible.
- To revoke access, clear saved auth per service:

```bash
node bin/agent-usage auth clear claude
node bin/agent-usage auth clear chatgpt
node bin/agent-usage auth clear github-copilot
```

Browser installation:

- Playwright Chromium is installed automatically on `pnpm install` via a postinstall script. If this fails in your environment, install manually:

```bash
pnpm exec playwright install chromium --with-deps
```

## Usage

```bash
# Query all services
node bin/agent-usage

# Single service
node bin/agent-usage --service claude
node bin/agent-usage --service chatgpt
node bin/agent-usage --service github-copilot

# JSON output
node bin/agent-usage --json
node bin/agent-usage --service claude --json
```

> ℹ️ `pnpm run start` triggers a clean rebuild before executing the CLI. The shorter `pnpm run usage` script skips the rebuild step and is intended only when `dist/` is already up to date.

## Output

Human-readable format shows:

- Utilization percentage per window (5-hour, 7-day, monthly)
- Usage rate vs expected rate
- Reset times
- Color coding: 🟢 on track | 🟡 over budget | 🔴 significantly over

JSON format returns structured data for programmatic use.
